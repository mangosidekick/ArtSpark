# ArtSpark 🎨
<i><b>ArtSpark is a application created in Android Studio using Java and XML, created for artists to import images into a canvas to use for reference, inspiration and planning projects.</b></i>

Inspired by the need to make [<i>"moodboards" or "visionboards"</i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_board) requires the collage of multiple images together to use as a presentation tool!

Artspark offers productivity by allowing users to add tasks to a to-do list and view a calendar with their added tasks after creating the foundational vision for their projects via moodboard.

Finding images from the internet, and places like pinterest, has never been easier to gather together in one canvas for everyone to use for their personal and professional projects!
